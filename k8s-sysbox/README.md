# Getting started

This template will create your workspace as a Kubernetes pod within our cluster. Contribute to this template [on GitHub](https://github.com/bpmct/coder-templates/tree/main/k8s-sysbox).

## Supported images

The following images have been tested with Coder. You can use any image in the registry, however.

- [codercom/enterprise-base:ubuntu](https://github.com/coder/enterprise-images/tree/main/images/base): Base image with curl, bash, git, python3, docker, docker-compose
- [codercom/enterprise-java:ubuntu](https://github.com/coder/enterprise-images/tree/main/images/base): Base image + OpenJDK 8, Maven 3.6, Gradel 6.7

## Troubleshooting

For help with your workspace, please contact us on our dedicated [Slack channel](https://slack.com)
